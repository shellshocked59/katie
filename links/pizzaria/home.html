<h1>Home</h1>
<p>Fishel's Pizza recently opened in the Nickel Plate district. We have already become a popular place for family and friends to meet and have a great meal. Fishel's offers many kinds of pizza, both thin and thick crust. We also have delicious appetizers and salads. There is ample seating on the inside of the restaurant and more seating on our lovely shaded patio outside. Carry-out orders are available or just sit back and relax and we will bring it to you with our fast, reliable delivery service!
</p>
<p>Please look through our Web site to learn more about our menu. Want to place a carry-out order? Call us at (999) 555-SABAS or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:fishelspizzeria@isp.com"> fishelspizzeria@isp.com</a></p>
